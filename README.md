![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-blue.svg)
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-private-red.svg)

A Docker Compose setup for managing self-hosted services in a private home server environment, using Traefik as reverse proxy.

## Architecture

This system uses Traefik as the entry point with:
- Port 443: LAN access with Let's Encrypt certificate
- Port 8443: External access via Cloudflare tunnel (useful for CG-NAT topology)

## FAQ

### Q: I'm having trouble generating the Let's Encrypt certificate.  üîê
**A:** The issue might be caused by the default configuration enabling the Cloudflared certificate. To resolve the problem, disable the Cloudflared certificate in your configuration `tls.yml` so that the Let's Encrypt certificate can be generated successfully.
